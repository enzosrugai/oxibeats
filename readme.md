# Oxibeats
## Terminal-Based binaural beats generator for increased focus, written in Rust. 

Listening to 40Hz binaural beats has been shown to improve concentration when compared to melodic music, white noise, pink noise, or brown noise [citation needed]. This micro app generates and plays one sine wave in each ear, 40Hz apart. This tricks your brain into hearing a 40Hz sound even though none is technically present.

**Requires Headphones**
